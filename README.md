- 👋 Hi, I’m @acidminded95
- 👀 I’m interested in philosophy, languages, music, nature and programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Data Science with Python (using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Scikitlearn),
as well as CSS and Javascript for web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve awareness towards climate change and wildlife conservation,
as well as those aiming to help people with different capabilities.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can contact me right here, I'm learning how to use GitHub and having more interactions through here would certainly help!
